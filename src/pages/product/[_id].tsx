      review: "If you don't want to drop hundreds on a pair of headphones while still getting the features of a quality item, I would recommend these. If you care about noise cancellation and noise insulation (others not being able to hear what you're listening to) these aren't for you. But if you don't mind those things everything else is perfect.\n" +

        "Notably my favorite part about these is the battery life. I've left them on for days and the battery only goes down like 25% max. The battery lasted me two weeks after the first charge when I bought them! Super good battery life. Also, the exterior design is minimalistic and fashionable. There's room to decorate with stickers if you wanna get creative with the design too. I even kind of like that these aren't noise cancelation headphones because I wear them in public spaces where I need to be aware of my surroundings, like the gym, so they're good for that.",
